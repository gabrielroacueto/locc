Ideas

- Add cobra CLI
- Ability to feed in user context before understand command.
- Ability to understand a single file
- Automatically generate "wiki" style documentation for the repo
- Given a file name and a function, generate context from the repo, then the project (maybe pull readme) and generate docs for function
- Special convention to work with this tool (user dumps docs in wiki folder or something)
