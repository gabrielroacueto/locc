Ideas

- Ability to understand a single file
- Automatically generate "wiki" style documentation for the repo
- Given a file name and a function, generate context from the repo, then the project (maybe pull readme) and generate docs for function
- Special convention to work with this tool (user dumps docs in wiki folder or something)


More Ideas
- Ask yourself, what would help someone make a PR faster?
  - Understand the contents of each directory and file? Maybe make it browseable somehow?
  - Generating documentation accessible through some sort of UI may be the key?
  - Maybe these docs can be integrated with some sort of search system, all local?

Goal to test:

- Look for an open or closed PR in `nvim` and what it changes and why.
- See if you could've made that PR by going through the information generated by LLM

Final test:
- Go to an open source repo
- Find an open issue
- Use your tool to quickly understand where the change needs to happen
